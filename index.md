[E-Scooter Trips Prediction in Philadelphia: Case Study of Minneapolis](/Project_RMarkdown/Philadelphia-E-Scooter-Prediction.html)
<br>
Micro-mobility is seen as a solution to alleviating the last-mile gridlock, especially shared and dock-less electric scooters. However, legalizing them in Pennsylvania is still at a stand still for two years due to safety concerns. COVID-19 might be a turning point for cities to reconsider e-scooters as a legal transportation method because it enables people to open to the air and keep socially distant at the meantime. This project aims to explore the spatial-temporal e-scooter trip pattern in Minneapolis and build the model to predict the probable spatial pattern of e-scooter in Philadelphia in the future. The project used stepwise regression method with log-transformed dependent variables, outflow trips and inflow trips, to build the models.

[Philly 311 Call Data Analysis](/Project_RMarkdown/Philly-311-Call-Analysis.html)
<br>
Philly 311 is a telephone and web services that allows residentis to report nonemergency complaints on city services directly to relevant departments. This analysis figures out the priority problems of city services on Census-tract-level and street-level, and helps the governmen† make data-driven decisions on improving Philadelphia city services.

[Mapping the Relationship between Vegetation and Poverty & Race in Philadelphia](/pdf/Vegetation-Poverty-Race.pdf)
<br>
Abundant research proved that access to greenspace varies highly based on income, level of education, gender, race, age and other socioeconomic and personal characteristics differences. A common finding is that income and level of education are positively correlated with a greater accessibility to greenspace, while low-income, racial minorities and other vulnerable groups in the city have less access to vegetation. According to the reports, this situation is happening in Philadelphia, especially the lack of trees in poor neighborhood. We need to ensure if it is true and where exactly demand for more trees. The analysis figures out the imbalance of accessibility to vegetation between different income groups and races, which is the legacy of structural racism in Philadelphia.

[Finding Suitable On-Road Testing Sites for Autonomous Vehicles in Philadelphia](/pdf/Finding the suitable road-testing sites for AVs in Philadelphia.pdf)
<br>
The widespread of Autonomous Vehicle (AV) has never been seen as close as it seems now with the confluence of advanced technologies and supportive regulations from local governments. The United States (US) is home to companies that lead the world in AV development, contributing to strong performance in technology and innovation ranking No.1 around the world1. In the Automated vehicles 3.0 published in October 2018 by the US Department of Transportation, it declared principles towards AVs including prioritizing safety and preparing for automation through guidance and pilot programs, etc. 
<br><br>
Pennsylvania, with two world-class research universities, Carnegie Mellon University and University of Pennsylvania, has emerged as a leading location for on-road testing of HAVs. To ensure the safety on road, Pennsylvania has passed two laws related to autonomous vehicles and regulations by the department of transportation. However, there is still a long way to go to avoid the fatal accident in Arizona. The safety of AVs on road depends on the operation system, human behavior and external environment. While engineers are working on the technologies of AV itself to improve the safety and accuracy of system, we, as a transportation planner, will work on the road infrastructure and regulations on AVs. The term project aims to provide a baseline for PennDOT to regulate the location where AVs could test on road, considering the AV’s reaction to the external environments, including road conditions, geological conditions, weather conditions and demographic conditions.
