[E-Scooter Trips Prediction in Philadelphia: Case Study of Minneapolis](/Project_RMarkdown/Philadelphia-E-Scooter-Prediction.html)
<br>
Micro-mobility is seen as a solution to alleviating the last-mile gridlock, especially shared and dock-less electric scooters. However, legalizing them in Pennsylvania is still at a stand still for two years due to safety concerns. COVID-19 might be a turning point for cities to reconsider e-scooters as a legal transportation method because it enables people to open to the air and keep socially distant at the meantime. This project aims to explore the spatial-temporal e-scooter trip pattern in Minneapolis and build the model to predict the probable spatial pattern of e-scooter in Philadelphia in the future. The project used stepwise regression method with log-transformed dependent variables, outflow trips and inflow trips, to build the models.

[Philly 311 Call Data Analysis](/Project_RMarkdown/Philly-311-Call-Analysis.html)

Philly 311 is a telephone and web services that allows residentis to report nonemergency complaints on city services directly to relevant departments. This analysis figures out the priority problems of city services on Census-tract-level and street-level, and helps the governmenâ€  make data-driven decisions on improving Philadelphia city services.

[Mapping the Relationship between Vegetation and Poverty & Race in Philadelphia](/pdf/Vegetation-Poverty-Race.pdf)
<br>
Abundant research proved that access to greenspace varies highly based on income, level of education, gender, race, age and other socioeconomic and personal characteristics differences. A common finding is that income and level of education are positively correlated with a greater accessibility to greenspace, while low-income, racial minorities and other vulnerable groups in the city have less access to vegetation. According to the reports, this situation is happening in Philadelphia, especially the lack of trees in poor neighborhood. We need to ensure if it is true and where exactly demand for more trees. The analysis figures out the imbalance of accessibility to vegetation between different income groups and races, which is the legacy of structural racism in Philadelphia.
