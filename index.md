### STATISTICAL & SPATIAL ANALYSIS

[E-Scooter Trips Prediction in Philadelphia: Case Study of Minneapolis](/Project_RMarkdown/Philadelphia-E-Scooter-Prediction.html)
<br>
Micro-mobility is seen as a solution to alleviating the last-mile gridlock, especially shared and dock-less electric scooters. However, legalizing them in Pennsylvania is still at a stand still for two years due to safety concerns. COVID-19 might be a turning point for cities to reconsider e-scooters as a legal transportation method because it enables people to open to the air and keep socially distant at the meantime. This project aims to explore the spatial-temporal e-scooter trip pattern in Minneapolis and build the model to predict the probable spatial pattern of e-scooter in Philadelphia in the future. The project used stepwise regression method with log-transformed dependent variables, outflow trips and inflow trips, to build the models.
